## About
The current version of all plugins work well with no significant bugs that I've found, so I'll not update any plugin that
I've already installed, even if they come with flashy new features or whatever, they will stay the same unless I **REALLY**
need to update something. In fact updating _usually_ breaks everything at the moment, so no updates coming ever :)

**Versions**:
- Neovim 0.10
- Windows 11

## Philosophy
Simplicity above all, meaning:
- Just a few plugins (37 total)
- Avoid modularizing and keep everything most in one place.
- Edit config as little as possible (ideally once per year once stable).
- Whenever I feel I need a plugin look for native alternatives, develop it myself or avoid temptation from the evil :)
