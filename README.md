# Philosophy

Simplicity above all, meaning:
    - Just a few plugins
    - Avoid modularizing and keep everything in one place
    - Edit config as little as possible
    - Whenever I feel I need a plugin look for native alternatives, develop it myself or avoid temptation from the evil :)

The current version of my editor works very well with very little/no bugs, so I'll not update the plugins that
I've already installed, even if they come with flashy new features or whatever, they will stay the same unless I REALLY
need to update something. 

Versions:

- Neovim 0.10
- Neovide 0.14.1
- Windows 11
